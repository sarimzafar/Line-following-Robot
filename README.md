# Objective of the Project

The main objective of the MTE 220 project is to understand the practical aspects of sensor implementation and interfacing. These aspects include awareness of component tolerances, noise and various design trade-offs. With the use of a microcontroller, an integrated programmer for the microcontroller, power regulation, and a variety of sensors, an optimal small, line-following mobile robot has to be designed, built and programmed in C. The sensor suite included a pushbutton, optical encoders, Hall-effect sensor, infrared light detection, temperature measurement, and overall system current sensing.
